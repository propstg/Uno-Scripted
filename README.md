## Features
* Keeps track of player turn rotation and direction
* Automation of special cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Cards)
* UI elements for player decisions (Wild Cards, Card Stacking, Turn Passing, ect.)
* A 'Main Menu' to configure the game how you want to play it
* Anti 'greifing' features
  * You can not drop any of the cards in your hand
  * You can not take any cards from another player's hand
  * You can not put any of your cards into another player's hand

## Currently Supported House Rules
* Stacking of +2 cards onto +2 cards
  * Increasing the number of cards to be drawn by the next player by 2 if they are unable to continue stacking
* Stacking of +4 WILD cards onto +4 WILD cards
  * Increasing the number of cards to be drawn by the next player by 4 if they are unable to continue stacking
* Draw multiple cards per turn instead of only 1
  * [Optional] Allow player's to pass their turn after they have drawn a card
* Play with 2 Decks [Feature submitted by contributer : propstg]
  * Two decks means twice the number of cards. More wild cards, more draw cards, more everything!

## Expirimental Features
* 7-0 rules
  * 7-0 rules have been implimented into the script, but there are still some bugs to work out so you can turn these rules on or off from the Main Menu
* Scripted UNO! calling
  * The script can handle calling UNO! on some one with the press of a button, but there are still some bugs to work out so this can be disabled from the Main Menu
